## About Project
Our mission is to provide a way for people to build, own, monetize, and socialize in immersive and decentralized virtual spaces. We also want to bring many different NFT projects that exist today to have their community fully connected; play, shop, work, and socialize in metaverse â€” in short, do the things humans like to do together in real life.
Players and NFT projects can use the features below (for free, of course)

- Turning 2D NFTs into a wearable T-Shirt for your avatar
- Limiting your metaverse to "NFT owners only"
- Customize the metaverse to fit your NFT project world
- Place 2D & 3D NFTs in metaverse

## Problem 
These are problems we try to solve.
- 2D NFTs have no usage other than showing off on Twitter/Discord, which provide few utilties.
- 3D avatar/item can be difficult to prove creative ownership of works, especially as content is copied very easily.
- Existing 3D avatar/item marketplaces are based on fiat currencies such as JPY or USD, which do not support true decentralization and are vulnerable to credit card fraud.

## Technologies
Blockchain : Polygon, Ethereum. (Avalanche, BNB, Fantom coming very soon)

## Challenges faced.
We struggled in developing function to make your avatar wear 3D NFTs. 3D files have a lot more file types and bone structures than 2D files, therefore building the system took a lot of time. We also troubled on hosting the metaverse on web, because in order to build metaverse on web, we needed to use WebGL which is still in early stage to use.
