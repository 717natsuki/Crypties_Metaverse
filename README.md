# Metaverse & 3D NFT Marketplace 
## Project Name
Zoa.space

## About Project
Our mission is to provide a way for people to build, own, monetize, and socialize in immersive and decentralized virtual spaces. We also want to bring many different NFT projects that exist today to have their community fully connected; play, shop, work, and socialize in metaverse â€” in short, do the things humans like to do together in real life.
- Players and NFT projects can use the features below (for free, of course, XD )
- Turning 2D NFTs into a wearable T-Shirt for your avatar
- Limiting your metaverse to "NFT owners only"
- Customize the metaverse to fit your NFT project world
- Place 2D & 3D NFTs in metaverse
