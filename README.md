## About Project
Crypties is an NFT supported social networking service that can be downloaded on App Store and Google Play Store right now. You can search NFTs and you can also post NFTs and use NFTs as your profile image.


## Problem 
These are problems we try to solve.
- 2D NFTs have no usage other than showing off on Twitter/Discord, which provide few utilties.
- 2D images/videos/gifs can be difficult to prove creative ownership of works, especially as content is copied very easily.

## Technologies
Blockchain: Polygon, Ethereum.
Frontend: Flutter
Backend: GCP/Dart

## Challenges faced.
The app was rejected by Apple more than 20 times for review. It seemed that the terms and conditions to submit on App Store did not reflect whether it was okay for crypto-based apps to be released on the App Store, and what Apple staff were saying differed from person to person, making it difficult. Some times our app were rejected just for logging in with MetaMask. We did not give up, and after repeated discussions with Apple staff, we were finally able to release the app.
